                <h5 class="section-header">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5> 
                    <p>Improving your emotional intelligence can lead to a successful meaningful life. I used to think it's a heavy subject to discuss let alone to think this way as a habit. After reading the chapter I'm open to change my thinking and ready to embrace the posibilities. I noted down the three steps mentioned in the book as a reminder to myself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attention Training</li>
                            <li>Self-knowledge and self-mastery</li>
                            <li>Creating useful mental habits</li>
                        </ul>
                <h5 class="section-header">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5> 
                    <p>Quite relaxing. I feel like I can control and re-organise my chain of thoughts during the two mins midfulness. The next challenge is how to make it a habit.</p>
