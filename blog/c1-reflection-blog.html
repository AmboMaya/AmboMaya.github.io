          <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>

              <p>I think it's very inspiring. This way of learning is very new to me and I feel very encouraged and excited for all the possibilities that this experience will have for me.</p>

          <h4>What are your impressions?</h4> 

              <p>It will be quite challenging especially where I'm used to the traditional way of learning. However, learning as an adult with this method I think it will be very effective.</p>
              
          <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
                
              <p>I'm not sure. I'm a bit of an introvert but I believe having positive relationships with people around you is crucial. I'm glad to hear about the headphone policy. 
                  It's a great reminder by Sheereef that this is not a solo learning culture but a strong involvement of team work. 
              </p>
              
          <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
                
              <p>Not really. In fact, some great points were discussed in the video which I think I will use as a reminder when things get difficult during the learning process. 
                  For example, exposing your ignorance isn't the worst thing and it's good to tell yourself that "you don't know".
                  Keep asking question how much I would get out of the experience will be valueable to push myself to the limit.
              </p>
              
          <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4> 
                
              <p>I'm excited but also nervous at the same time. I always wanted to learn how to learn. In the video someone asked about how can you be creative when you're a beginner. 
                  I had the same worries about not being creative and the answer Shereef gave was quite encourangin that creativity will come as your skills grow.
