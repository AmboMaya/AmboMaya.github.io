                   <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
                   <p>I guess everything goes in cycles. Even life in general has its ups and downs time. As pesimistic as I sound, I think all pleasures will always come to an end and one day pleasure will become a normal thing. This
                        may be the exact opposite way the author wants the reader to think or just irrelevant. I don't see this concept align to my way of way thinking.

How about satisfaction and contentment while we're still feel motivated and passionate, and still experience happiness.</p>

                   <p>Paying more attention to my feelings when experiencing failure and be aware of these feelings do help to overcome obstacles. I really appreciate the idea about training resilience on cognitive level, that is, understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits to help develop optimism.</p>
