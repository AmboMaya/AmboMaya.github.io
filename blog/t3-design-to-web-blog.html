                   <p>Frameworks are built code that offers customs solutions or functionalities for website properties.</p>
                    <p>Pros:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list">It saves a lot of time in developments</li>
                        <li class="list">It offers a standardization</li>

                        <li class="list">The owner of frameworks can introduce any new features that you may not necessarily need for your project. This also ties in to the fact that you're locked-in to use the framework once you start your project. You have less choice change to another sollution because you would have invested time to adopt it in the first place. Thus it is important to do a thorough research for framework that best suits your project need.</p></li>
