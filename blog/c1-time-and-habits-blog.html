      <h4>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>

        <p>Pamodoro technique</p>

      <h4>what did you find interesting?</h4> 

        <p>I foud all the reading materials on this topic are very very interesting and helpful. 
            I've heard about Pamodoro technique before and have attempted to apply this technique to my working/studying schedules. 
            I also think that tiny habit technique makes so much sense and will work well if combined together with pamodoro.

      <h4>what worked for you?</h4>

        <p>Pamodoro technique</p>

      <h4>which will you experiment further with?</h4>

        <p>I would like to learn more about the counterintuitive concept particularly a couple of points; "less time to be more productive and make it painful for not to do".
