                   <h5>Compassionate Leadership</h5>
                   <p>My personal experience with compassionate leadership leads to feeling happiness and joyful coming to work as subordinate not as the leader. I have also experienced not so compassionate leadership which result in resignation due to so much unhappiness. This book has some realistic points. </p>

                   <h5>Multiplying goodness meditation</h5>
                   <p>You will need to do this meditation with open heart and the right state of mind. I grew up with a religious background in Indonesia and we had a curriculum at school that teaches us about practising good morale, compassion, tolerance, living in a harmonious society, etc. When you were young you don't really know the real meaning of these until you experience them personally in your adult life. 
                       I did this somewhere quiet no distraction with a headphone on. The experience was pleasnt. I felt warmth in my chest and feeling peaceful. It may sound a bit exagerating but for me it really helps to take away some negative feelings and judgements towards others.</p>

                   <p>I felt a lot of sadness when I attempted doing tonglen meditation. I tried imagining others suffering I do however feel tenderness.</p>

                   <p>I think this model will play a big role during the bootcamp. Status reward is such a good point; improving your skills you activate a status reward relative to your former self - playing againts yourself. </p>
                   <p>I have to admit that I have been feeling uncertainty when during phase 0. I really hope this feeling will go away once we start the bootcamp. </p>
