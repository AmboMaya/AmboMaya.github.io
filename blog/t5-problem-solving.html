                   <p>When you're learning new topics, subjects or skills, you'll be faced with problems along the way. Depending where you are in the learning process, the 
                       level of difficulties of the problems you're facing varies. Not all problems are hard to solve, sometimes it's only the matter getting familiar with how things work.  
                   </p>
                   <p>My experience stumbling across a simple problem was when I completed 95% of the code within a short time but spent almost an hour searching for the remaining 10% of the puzzle before the code can run the way it should.
                   I had another problem and spent a long time for the solution. I had everything needed for the code to work except it's written in a wrong order.</p>
                   <p>The most recent problem I had was creating the simple game circle using JS. This was the trickiest so far. I mostly rely on google to find for best sollution to my problems. The chances are other people may have had similar problems and would recommended sollution. Phrasing a question properly is crucial for finding best possible sollution. I'm learning a lot through problem solving process. I realised there are many different ways you can write a code that does the same thing, some might be written bettern than the other.  </p>

                   <h5>Self-reflection on Problem Solving Techniques</h5>
                   <ul>
                       <li> Pseudocode</li>
                       <p class="indented">I haven't done many of the Pseudocode before but I did it once for one of the challenges in this sprint. It worked perfectly, i'll be using this technique more in the future.</p>
                       <li>Reading error messages</li>
                       <p class="indented">I found using google chrome debugging tool very useful. I can see how to code is running in action and it will tell me where the error is. Still need practicing on reading error messages.</p>
                       <li>Console.logging</li>
                       <p class="indented"> I'm getting better at Console.logging code to find error or just to know the returning value of something</p>
                       <li>Googling</li>
                       <p class="indented">Googling is my number one problem solving technique</p>
                       <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                       <p class="indented">I posted my first question on the EDA code-help Slack channel today. I think it's a good start because you could even find the solution while drafting your question and things could suddenly make sense.</p>
                       <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
