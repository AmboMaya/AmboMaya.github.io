                   <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
                   <p>In the book Search Inside Yourself, the author referenced definition of mindfulness and self awareness.</p>
                   <blockquote>"Self-awareness ... is aneutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turulent emotions. —Daniel Golememan"</blockquote>
                   <blockquote>“Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. —Jon Kabat-Zinn”</blockquote>
                   <p>Mindfulness controls your emotion and mind, and with self awareness, your mind knows exactly how to handle the situation reflecting to your personalities.</p>

                   <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
                </h5>
                   <p>I tried Journaling. This is a good way for me to set free any tangled thoughts in my head. It worked for me as I can reflect and try to understand my own state of mind. </p>

                   <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
                   <p>I agree, the feeling doesn't make who we are. The feeling is just what we experience and not part of us being. And when you feel down, think that the feeling is only temporary. Or when you experience difficulties solving a problem, it's not because you're incompetent and there will always be a way to solve it as part of the process. <s>    </s></p>
