                    <h6>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h6>
                    <p>It's a really good reminder not to overdoing task. This concepts helps me to prioritise things more and only do what's required to do. I didn't spend 30hours on this fortunately however I still feel like I could still cut the time shorter if I really follow 'process over product concept'. </p>

                    <h6>What did you think about meditation before reading ch 2?</h6>
                    <p>I thought meditation is to calm your busy mind and loose tention. At least this is why I mediate for. I never really thought of meditating to improve personal quality such as emotional intelligence. I think it's the next level of mediation that I'll be keen to look into closely. </p>

                    <h6>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h6>
                    <p>I never really get deep into the concept of mediation so there are a lot of new things I learned from the book. Some of the new things i learnt is about meta-attention. The book metioned that the big secret of meditaion is to get your mind relaxed and alert at the same time. It gets more interesting when it continues saying that when attnetion and meta-attention both become strong, your mind becomes increasingly focused and stable.  </p>

                    <p>Yes, definitely. There's so much valueble information to take on. To practise it religiously would be another different story.</p>
