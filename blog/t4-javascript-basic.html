                   <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                   <p>Javascript (JS) is an object oriented programming language wherease HTML is a markup language whose job is to display it to the eyes of the user. With JS you can add functionality or behaviour to the web application. Not only JS is used to make a website to visuallly look attractive and interactive, it can also be used on the server side i.e how your website can be available on the webservice and how people use your site. A more technical feature JS can do is that it can change the type of variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the programming is running.</p>

                   <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>
                   <p>The analogy of control flow is like before we can be at work, we need to actually leave the house and make a trip to the office. As a total beginner to JS, my high level understanding of contro flow is like, for some lines of codes to work, the order of which the codes are executed will need to be logical to the order of how they have been declared or run under different conditions. loops in JS is when 
                       a set of code repeated in any amount of times for any amount of items like arrays or objects. The day to day analogy for this is the process I go through everyday; getting out of bed, take a shower, brush teeth, get dressed and put make up on, leave the house, get to my car and drive to work. This process goes on the same way for 5 days a week. On the weekend, my routines change slightly. This will keep going until one day I decide to stop working. </p>

                   <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h5>
                   <p>Objects and arrays data are represented differently. An object is surounded by curly braces { } and an array surrounded by square brackets [ ]. Data arrays can be accessed by [ ] with its index specified inside the brackets or the value. On the other hand, to access an object's property we need to use a period sign (.) followed by variable name and name of the property. See example below:</p>
                   <p>var myFavouriteNumber = [32, 25, 27, 40]. To access the data of students array, student[0] which will return number 32. <br>
                    var student = { name: "maya", age: 32, city:"auckland"} to access property age of the object student: student.age will return 32.</p>

                   <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                   <p>A function can be described in an analogy like a recipe for your favourite chocolate cake. You use this recipe to make your own cake and since the steps and ingridients have already been written for you, you can use this recipe and even modify it to how you like it.
                        w3schools.com define function as a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions can customize behaviour and can be reuse through out the program. To have intelligent functions can save you a lot of time and is probably one of the keys to run a smart application.  </p>
